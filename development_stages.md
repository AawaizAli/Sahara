To build **Sahara**, your voice-first medical triage system, efficiently and scalably, here‚Äôs a detailed **step-by-step development plan** broken into phases: **Planning ‚Üí MVP ‚Üí Expansion ‚Üí Production**. Each phase aligns technical development with your product vision.

---

## ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Planning & Architecture Design**

### **1. Define Core Use Cases**

* User speaks symptoms
* Bot dynamically asks relevant follow-up questions
* Bot suggests a likely condition
* User gets matched to a doctor
* Appointment is scheduled

### **2. Finalize Tech Stack**

| Layer          | Tools                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **STT**        | Whisper / Vosk (local or server), multi-language    |
| **NLP**        | Rasa / MedCAT / SciSpacy for symptom extraction     |
| **Voice Bot**  | Sesame (for conversational dynamics)                |
| **TTS**        | Coqui TTS / Piper                                   |
| **Frontend**   | React (for web), React Native or Swift/Kotlin later |
| **Backend**    | FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery               |
| **Scheduling** | Cal.com / FullCalendar                              |
| **Deployment** | Docker, Railway / Render / Fly.io (for MVP)         |
| **Versioning** | GitHub with `main`, `dev`, and `bots/*` branches    |

## üöÄ **Phase 2: MVP Development (Rapid Prototyping)**

### **1. Voice Bot Prototypes (Individual Contributions)**

* Each team member works in `bots/{name}` with:

  * `main.py`
  * `requirements.txt`
  * Uses same STT/TTS pipeline
* Try out different pipelines (e.g., Whisper + Coqui + Rasa vs. Sesame)

### **2. Basic React Frontend**

* Create minimal React UI:

  * Mic button to record
  * Chat-style view of user-bot messages
* Connect it to your backend API

### **3. Backend APIs (FastAPI)**

* `/stt`: Accept audio input ‚Üí return transcript
* `/bot`: Accept text input ‚Üí return bot response
* `/tts`: Convert text to voice
* `/symptoms`: Store or return current symptoms
* `/doctors`: Match with a doctor
* `/appointments`: Create an appointment

### **4. Build the NLP Pipeline**

* Symptom extraction using MedCAT/SciSpacy
* Basic rule or ML-based dynamic question generator

### **5. Connect Bot to Triage Flow**

* Store user responses and track session state
* Ask dynamic questions based on previous symptoms
* Return a basic diagnosis suggestion

---

## üîÅ **Phase 3: Integration & Iteration**

### **1. Replace Rule-Based Flow with Dynamic NLP**

* Integrate Sesame's conversational model
* Let it handle back-and-forth, emotion, and context

### **2. Multilingual Support**

* Add Whisper multilingual STT
* Add Urdu/Sindhi dataset or fine-tuning
* Add multilingual support in TTS

### **3. Doctor Matching System**

* Design PostgreSQL schema for doctors (name, specialty, city, schedule)
* Create filtering logic (e.g., fever ‚Üí general physician)
* Schedule using Cal.com API or your own availability system

### **4. Appointment Scheduling**

* Show available time slots
* Let user book and confirm
* Email / SMS reminders using Celery tasks

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Phase 4: Infrastructure & Deployment**

### **1. Dockerize All Services**

* One container for STT
* One for TTS
* One for the bot
* One for the API
* One for the React frontend

### **2. CI/CD Pipelines**

* Use GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
* Auto-deploy `main` to production, `dev` to staging

### **3. Hosting**

* MVP: Use Railway / Fly.io for backend, Vercel for frontend
* Production: Use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm (optional scaling)

---

## üì± **Phase 5: Appification (Mobile Support)**

Once the system is stable:

### **1. Build Native Apps**

* iOS: SwiftUI
* Android: Kotlin Jetpack
* OR: Use React Native for cross-platform support

### **2. Connect to Shared Backend**

* Use APIs already built in FastAPI
* Reuse TTS/STT pipelines
* Implement real-time updates via WebSockets or polling

---

## üîí **Phase 6: Data, Security & Analytics**

### **1. User Data Privacy**

* Encrypt stored audio
* Anonymize diagnosis data
* Add opt-in consent prompts

### **2. Admin Panel**

* Track user interactions
* Add doctors & manage availability
* Export logs for triage research

### **3. Analytics**

* Track most common symptoms
* Measure latency of voice responses
* Track successful doctor matches

---

## üß† **Phase 7: Intelligence & Scaling**

### **1. Symptom ‚Üí Disease Classifier**

* Train custom model using open symptom datasets
* Rank possible conditions by confidence

### **2. Feedback Loop**

* Let users rate diagnosis
* Use ratings to fine-tune dynamic questioning

### **3. Train Custom Voice Models**

* Collect Urdu/Sindhi data
* Fine-tune Sesame or Coqui for localized fluency
